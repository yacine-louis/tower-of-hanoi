# Tower Of Hanoi

- conditions:

1. one disk can be moved at time
2. only top disk of the stack can be moved
3. larger disk can never be placed on top of a smaller disk(we assume that this is respected in the starting configuration)

4. implement the recursive version:
   1.1. For different values of the number of disks n, increasing progressively, execute the program and report the execution time.
   1.2. From what value of n does the program become unable to produce a solution?
   1.3. Present a table of numerical results and a corresponding graph.
   1.4. What can you conclude?
5. implement the iterative version and repeat the same experimental study
6. Compare your results with the theoretical results obtained in class.
7. Compare the two iterative and recursive methods.

8. Write a report answering all the above questions. The report must include:
   • A description of the experimental setup (machine characteristics, programming language, etc.).
   • An analysis of the obtained results.
   • A clear and well-structured presentation.
   • A declaration specifying each group members contribution.
